Subject: [PATCH 033/112] change stop condition to avoid infinite loops

In net/net.c there is a while (1) that only exits if there is a stop
condition and more then 10 packages or if there is no package received.

If GRUB is idle and enter in this loop, the only condition to leave is
if it doesn't have incoming packages. In a network with heavy traffic
this never happens.
